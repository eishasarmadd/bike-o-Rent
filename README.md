Bike Rentals SQL Project

## Overview

The Bike Rentals SQL Project is designed to manage and analyze a comprehensive database that tracks various aspects of bike rentals. The project involves creating, populating, and querying tables related to bike rentals, bike types, customers, and payments. This advanced SQL project helps in understanding complex database operations, including data insertion, data manipulation, and complex queries.

## Project Components

### Database Structure

The project consists of the following primary tables:

1. Bike Rentals (bike_rentals): Tracks individual bike rentals with details such as rental ID, bike ID, start time, distance, duration, and cancellation reasons.
2. Bike Types (bike_types): Contains information about different types of bikes, including type ID and type name.
3. Bikes (bikes): Lists all bikes along with their types, including bike ID, type ID, and bike name.
4. Customers (customers): Records customer information for each rental, including customer ID, name, email, phone number, and order date.
5. Payments (payment): Details the payments made for each rental, including payment ID, rental ID, customer ID, amount paid, payment date, and payment method.

### Key Features

- Data Insertion and Management: The project includes scripts for creating tables and inserting initial data, ensuring that the database is populated with realistic and diverse data for analysis.
- Complex Queries: A series of advanced SQL queries are implemented to extract meaningful insights from the data. These queries cover various SQL functionalities, such as joins, groupings, aggregations, window functions, and subqueries.
- Data Analysis and Reporting: The project demonstrates how to analyze rental data to derive valuable insights, such as customer behavior, bike usage patterns, and financial performance.

### Sample Queries

The project includes various advanced SQL queries, such as:

1. Listing All Bike Rentals Not Canceled: Retrieve all bike rentals that were not canceled.
2. Total Rentals for Each Bike: Calculate the total number of rentals for each bike.
3. Customer Rentals on a Specific Date: Retrieve all customers who rented bikes on a specific date.
4. Bike Types Analysis: List all available bike types and analyze rental durations and distances.
5. Customer Activity: Identify customers who have made multiple rentals and calculate the total amount paid by each customer.
6. Rental and Payment Analysis: Perform detailed analysis on rental durations, distances, and payment methods.

### Advanced SQL Techniques

- Window Functions: Utilized to rank and order data within partitions for advanced analytical queries.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used to simplify complex queries by breaking them down into modular, readable components.
- Subqueries: Implemented to perform operations on intermediate results for more refined data analysis.
- Aggregation and Grouping: Applied to summarize data and extract aggregate metrics for reporting purposes.

## Learning Outcomes

By working through this project, you will gain a deep understanding of:

- Designing and structuring relational databases for complex applications.
- Inserting and managing large datasets with SQL.
- Crafting and optimizing advanced SQL queries to analyze and report on data.
- Using advanced SQL features like window functions, CTEs, and subqueries to perform sophisticated data manipulations and analyses.

## Conclusion

The Bike Rentals SQL Project is an excellent opportunity to enhance your SQL skills by working on a real-world scenario. It provides a comprehensive learning experience, from setting up the database to performing advanced data analysis, preparing you for handling complex database management tasks in professional settings.
